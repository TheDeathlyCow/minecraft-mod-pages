# Immersive Storms

[![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/TheDeathlyCow/minecraft-mod-pages/main/scorchful/assets/try_scorchful.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/scorchful)

A small client-side mod that adds new fog and particle effects to various biomes, based on the weather.

# Sandstorms

Deserts, Badlands, and Savannas are now affected by Sandstorms. When it rains in the world, a dense sandy fog will close in and a fierce wind will kick up new dust particles. When thunderstorms roll in, this fog will get even thicker, making it very difficult to see where you are going.

# Snowy Fog

Fog is now whiter during snowy weather, and will get thicker during thunder storms, signalling a blizzard. While not as harsh as sandstorms, blizzards do still reduce visibility.

Windswept hills and mountains have been made more windy in all weather conditions. A soft breeze will now carry bits of dust and rock with them. Deserts and badlands have been given this effect too (though the sound is a vanilla thing).

# Compatibility


* **Scorchful**: This mod is a standalone extraction of the sandstorm feature from [Scorchful](https://modrinth.com/mod/scorchful) and is bundled with that mod as of 1.21.5.
* **Particle Rain**: This mod is also compatible with Particle Rain. Sandstorm particles and sounds will be automatically disabled if Particle Rain is detected.
* **Shader Packs**: The fog effects of this mod likely do not, and will not ever, work with most shaders packs as they have separate handling for fog. However, the particle and sound effects should work just fine.
* **Neoforge (Connector)**: This mod may work with Neoforge via Sinytra connector on versions where it is available; but this will neither be tested for nor supported.
